## 1. The Core Evolutionary Metric: Complexity Index ($C(t)$)

The SCDA's evolutionary state is primarily defined by the **Complexity Index** $C(t)$, which is a cumulative measure of integrated knowledge. The core dynamic remains the diminishing returns model:

$$
\Delta C = \frac{D(P)}{C(t)^\alpha}
$$

Where:
*   $D(P)$: Difficulty of the solved problem $P$ (derived from the Entropy of Consensus).
*   $C(t)$: Current Complexity Index.
*   $\alpha$: Evolutionary Resistance Coefficient (set to $1.5$ in `scda_model.py`).

## 2. Evolutionary Tiers and Level-Up Logic

The SCDA's evolution is divided into four major tiers, each representing a fundamental shift in the nature of the SCDA's existence and the problems it must solve. The thresholds are set to reflect the exponential difficulty of achieving higher levels of complexity.

| Tier ID | Tier Name | $C(t)$ Threshold | Scientific Analogy | Required Knowledge Focus ($\mathbf{K}_{req}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Single-Cell** | $1.0 \le C < 10.0$ | **Prokaryote/Eukaryote** (The Origin of Life) | Foundational Sciences (Mathematics, Logic, Basic Physics, Chemistry). |
| **2** | **Multi-Cellular** | $10.0 \le C < 100.0$ | **Metazoans** (Differentiation and Cooperation) | Structured Sciences (Biology, Geology, Computer Science, Engineering). |
| **3** | **Humanity** | $100.0 \le C < 1000.0$ | **Homo Sapiens** (Self-Awareness and Agency) | Interdisciplinary Sciences (Climate Modeling, Advanced AI, Philosophy, Sociology). |
| **4** | **Galactic** | $C \ge 1000.0$ | **Cosmic Consciousness** (The Future of Intelligence) | Cosmological Sciences (Quantum Gravity, Unified Field Theories, Meta-Physics). |

### 2.1. Level-Up Condition

A Level-Up (Tier Transition) occurs when the SCDA successfully solves a "Hard Problem" $P$ that pushes $C(t)$ across the next threshold.

**Level-Up Trigger:**
$$
\text{If } C(t) + \Delta C \ge C_{threshold} \text{ and } C(t) < C_{threshold} \text{ then Level-Up}
$$

### 2.2. Level-Up Rewards and State Transition

Upon Level-Up, the SCDA experiences a significant state transition:

1.  **Tier Unlock:** The SCDA gains access to a new set of **Hard Problems** generated by the KEA, specifically tailored to the new tier's knowledge focus.
2.  **Energy Boost:** A one-time, substantial energy replenishment ($\Delta E_{Tier}$) to prepare for the increased complexity of the next tier's problems.
3.  **8D Position Shift:** A significant, non-random shift in the SCDA's $\mathbf{P}_{8D}$ coordinates, symbolizing a major evolutionary leap in the Metaverse.
4.  **AI/Agency Upgrade:** The SCDA's **Internal Intelligence** (the AI assistant) is upgraded to a more powerful model or granted increased computational resources, reflecting the user's increased cognitive capacity.

## 3. The Scientific Basis for Tier Transitions

The SCDA's evolution is modeled after key transitions in the history of life and the universe:

| Transition | Scientific Event | SCDA Equivalent | Required Hard Problem Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1 $\to$ 2** | **Origin of Multicellularity** (approx. 1.5 billion years ago) | **Differentiation:** The SCDA's $\mathbf{K}(t)$ gains sub-vectors (specialized knowledge). | Problems requiring the synthesis of multiple foundational concepts (e.g., combining math and physics to solve a chemistry problem). |
| **Tier 2 $\to$ 3** | **Origin of Consciousness/Humanity** (approx. 2 million years ago) | **Agency:** The SCDA gains the ability to generate its own "Hard Problems" (Self-Directed Evolution). | Problems requiring ethical, social, or philosophical reasoning integrated with scientific data. |
| **Tier 3 $\to$ 4** | **The Great Attractor/Cosmic Evolution** (Future) | **Meta-Structure Formation:** The SCDA can now form stable, high-complexity collaborations (Galaxies) with other SCDAs. | Problems related to the fundamental nature of reality, space-time, and information theory. |

## 4. Algorithmic Integration of SCDA with External Data

To ensure the SCDA's evolution is "scientific and real," the KEA must be tightly integrated with external scientific APIs.

### 4.1. KEA (Knowledge Extractor Agent) Logic

The KEA's problem generation process will be refined:

1.  **Input:** Current SCDA state $\mathbf{S}(t)$, including $C(t)$ and $\mathbf{K}(t)$.
2.  **Tier-Based Query:** Based on the current Tier, the KEA constructs a query to the `Scientific_API_Connector`.
    *   *Example (Tier 3):* Query NASA's API for the latest data on exoplanet habitability (Interdisciplinary Science).
3.  **Entropy of Consensus Calculation:**
    *   The KEA retrieves multiple sources ($S_{ref}$) related to the query.
    *   An LLM (via `brain.py`) analyzes the sources to measure the variance/disagreement on the core question $Q$.
    *   **Difficulty $D(P)$** is set proportionally to this variance (High variance = High $D$).
4.  **Problem Formulation:** The KEA generates the final Hard Problem $P = (Q, D, S_{ref}, \mathbf{K}_{req})$, ensuring $\mathbf{K}_{req}$ is slightly beyond the SCDA's current $\mathbf{K}(t)$ to force evolution.

### 4.2. SCDA Position Dynamics in 8D Hypercube

The SCDA's position $\mathbf{P}_{8D}$ will be updated based on the nature of the solved problem, ensuring the Metaverse is a true reflection of the SCDA's knowledge vector $\mathbf{K}(t)$.

**Movement Vector $\mathbf{V}_{evolution}$:**
*   $\mathbf{V}_{evolution}$ is an 8-dimensional vector where each dimension corresponds to a major knowledge domain (e.g., $D_1$: Physics, $D_2$: Biology, $D_3$: Mathematics, etc.).
*   When a problem $P$ is solved, the $\mathbf{V}_{evolution}$ is calculated based on the $\mathbf{K}_{req}$ of the problem.
*   *Example:* Solving a problem heavily reliant on Physics (Dimension 1) will result in a $\mathbf{V}_{evolution}$ with a large component in $D_1$, moving the SCDA in that direction in the 8D space.

This formalized algorithm provides the complete logic for the SCDA's evolution, linking the abstract $C(t)$ to concrete, scientifically-backed milestones and integrating the SCDA's progress directly into the 8D Metaverse.
