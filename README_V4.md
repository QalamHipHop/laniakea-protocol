## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Systems

#### 1. 🔗 Blockchain Engine
A multi-dimensional blockchain where value is measured across six dimensions: **Knowledge**, **Computation**, **Originality**, **Consciousness**, **Time**, and **Complexity**. Each solution to a scientific problem creates a new block with multi-dimensional value.

#### 2. 🧠 Cognitive Core
An AI-powered system integrated with OpenAI's GPT models that can analyze problems, evaluate solutions, suggest improvements, and autonomously evolve the protocol.

#### 3. 🏛️ Governance System (DAO)
A decentralized autonomous organization where stakeholders can propose changes, vote on decisions, and automatically execute approved proposals. The AI can analyze proposals and provide recommendations.

#### 4. 🌐 DHT Network (Kademlia)
A distributed hash table for peer-to-peer networking, enabling decentralized storage, node discovery, and content addressing without central servers.

#### 5. 🤖 Machine Learning System
Internal neural networks for value prediction, pattern recognition, and reinforcement learning. The system learns from historical data to improve decision-making.

#### 6. ⚛️ Quantum Computing
Simulated quantum circuits and algorithms including Grover's search, Quantum Fourier Transform, and QAOA optimization. Provides quantum-resistant hashing and optimization capabilities.

#### 7. 💱 Exchange & Marketplace
A decentralized exchange for trading between value dimensions, featuring order books, automated market makers (AMM), and liquidity pools.

#### 8. 🆔 Identity System (DID)
Decentralized identity management with verifiable credentials, trust networks, and reputation scoring. Users build reputation through contributions.

#### 9. 🌍 Metaverse World
A 3D virtual world with multiple regions, avatars, portals, and social spaces. Users can explore, interact, and participate in events.
