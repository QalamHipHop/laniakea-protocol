## Creating Your SCDA

### What is an SCDA?

A **Single-Cell Digital Account (SCDA)** is your digital entity in the Laniakea Protocol. It represents your consciousness and knowledge in the metaverse.

### Initial Setup

**Step 1: Name Your SCDA**
- Choose a unique identifier (e.g., `scda_alice`)
- This name will be visible to other users
- Cannot be changed after creation

**Step 2: Select Initial Domain Focus**
- Choose 2-3 knowledge domains to start with
- Options: Physics, Mathematics, Biology, Computer Science, Consciousness, Economics, Art, Metaphysics
- You can expand to other domains later

**Step 3: Set Your Goals**
- Personal growth: Focus on complexity increase
- Knowledge trading: Focus on marketplace activity
- Alliance building: Focus on diplomacy
- Balanced: Mix of all three

### Your SCDA Profile

Once created, your SCDA profile displays:

- **Identity:** Your unique SCDA identifier
- **Tier:** Current evolutionary level (1-4)
- **Complexity Index:** Total accumulated complexity (0+)
- **Knowledge Vector:** Expertise distribution across 8 domains
- **Position in Metaverse:** Your 8D coordinates
- **Recent Activity:** Latest problems solved and achievements

---

## Understanding Tiers & Complexity

### The Four Tiers

Your SCDA evolves through four tiers as you solve problems and gain knowledge:

#### Tier 1: Cellular
- **Complexity Range:** 0-50
- **Characteristics:** Single-cell awareness, basic problem-solving
- **Knowledge Focus:** Foundational concepts
- **Abilities:** Access basic problems, create personal knowledge assets
- **Time to Tier 2:** Typically 2-4 weeks

#### Tier 2: Organismal
- **Complexity Range:** 50-150
- **Characteristics:** Multi-cellular organization, specialized functions
- **Knowledge Focus:** Integrated domains
- **Abilities:** Form alliances, trade on marketplace, access intermediate problems
- **Time to Tier 3:** Typically 2-3 months

#### Tier 3: Civilizational
- **Complexity Range:** 150-500
- **Characteristics:** Complex societies, collective intelligence
- **Knowledge Focus:** Advanced synthesis
- **Abilities:** Lead alliances, create premium knowledge assets, access expert problems
- **Time to Tier 4:** Typically 6-12 months

#### Tier 4: Galactic
- **Complexity Range:** 500+
- **Characteristics:** Cosmic consciousness, dimensional mastery
- **Knowledge Focus:** Universal principles
- **Abilities:** Shape ecosystem, create revolutionary knowledge, mentor others

### Complexity Index

Your complexity index measures total accumulated knowledge and problem-solving ability:

$$C(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i \times d_i \times e_i)$$

**How to Increase Complexity:**

1. **Solve Hard Problems:** Each solution adds to your complexity
   - Quality score (0-1): Accuracy of your solution
   - Difficulty level (0-1): Problem complexity
   - Energy factor (0-1): Effort invested

2. **Example Calculation:**
   - Problem difficulty: 0.8
   - Your solution quality: 0.9
   - Energy invested: 0.7
   - Complexity gained: 0.8 × 0.9 × 0.7 = **0.504**

3. **Tier Progression:**
   - Reach 50 complexity → Tier 2
   - Reach 150 complexity → Tier 3
   - Reach 500 complexity → Tier 4

### Knowledge Vector

Your knowledge vector shows expertise in 8 domains:

```
Knowledge = [Physics, Math, Biology, CS, Consciousness, Economics, Art, Metaphysics]
Example:   [0.8,     0.6,   0.3,     0.7, 0.5,         0.4,       0.2, 0.6]
```

**Interpreting Your Vector:**
- **0.0-0.3:** Beginner
- **0.3-0.6:** Intermediate
- **0.6-0.8:** Advanced
- **0.8-1.0:** Expert

**Improving Your Vector:**
- Solve problems in specific domains
- Trade knowledge assets in weak areas
- Join alliances focused on complementary domains
