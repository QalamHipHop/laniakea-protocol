## 🚀 Overview: The Unified Vision

LaniakeA Protocol is a revolutionary, long-term digital ecosystem that combines an **8-dimensional hypercube blockchain architecture** with a mechanism for **computational evolution through knowledge acquisition**.

It is designed to model the slow, persistent, and cumulative nature of cosmic evolution, where every user's digital presence, starting as a fundamental "Single-Cell Digital Account" (SCDA), evolves by identifying, solving, and integrating complex, real-world problems derived from vast academic and scientific sources.

The entire pattern is executed and modeled using **scientific and mathematical equivalents**, ensuring a process that extends over "extremely long periods, up to humanity and far, far longer for galaxies."

### ✨ Core Components

The LaniakeA Protocol is built on two integrated pillars:

#### 1. The 8-Dimensional Hypercube Blockchain (The Foundation)

This is the decentralized, secure, and high-dimensional infrastructure of the metaverse.
*   **8-Dimensional Blockchain**: Hypercube-based block structure with spatial coordinates.
*   **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Ensuring long-term security.
*   **AI-Powered Consensus**: Utilizing the internal intelligence layer for network validation.

#### 2. The Single-Cell Digital Account (SCDA) (The Evolution Engine)

This is the user's evolutionary state, a minimal data structure that grows through knowledge.
*   **Computational Evolution**: SCDA's **Complexity Index** ($C(t)$) increases only by solving "Hard Problems."
*   **Hard Problem Cycle**: Problems are generated by the **Knowledge Extractor Agent (KEA)** from academic sources and validated by a **Dual Validation Mechanism** ($\mathcal{V}_{int}$ and $\mathcal{V}_{quant}$).
*   **Mathematical Modeling**: The evolution is governed by a diminishing returns model to enforce the "extremely long" duration of the process.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The project is structured to separate the core blockchain components from the evolutionary intelligence layer:

*   `laniakea/core`: Core blockchain logic (e.g., `hypercube_blockchain.py`).
*   `laniakea/network`: P2P networking and API management.
*   `laniakea/intelligence`: **The SCDA and AI logic.**
    *   `scda_model.py`: Implementation of the Single-Cell Digital Account.
    *   `brain.py`: General AI intelligence components.
*   `examples`: Demonstration scripts (e.g., `scda_simulation.py`).
*   `docs`: Comprehensive documentation (Conceptual Design, Architecture, etc.).

## 📚 Key Documents

*   **Conceptual Design Document:** Detailed framework for the SCDA, the Problem Discovery/Solution Cycle, and the mathematical models governing evolution.
    *   [lanika_conceptual_design.md](lanika_conceptual_design.md)
*   **Technical Documentation**: Details on the 8-Dimensional Blockchain architecture.
    *   [TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION_v1.0.md](TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION_v1.0.md)

## ⚙️ Quick Start

To run the SCDA simulation example:

```bash
# Ensure you are in the laniakea-protocol directory
python3 examples/scda_simulation.py
```

To start the LaniakeA Protocol node (as per original project structure):

```bash
python3 main.py start --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
