# Lanika Metaverse Project

This repository contains the conceptual design and initial implementation for the **Lanika Metaverse**, a project focused on computational evolution through knowledge acquisition.

The core vision is to model a user's digital presence as a "Single-Cell Digital Account" (SCDA) that evolves over extremely long periods by successfully solving "Hard Problems" derived from vast academic and scientific sources. The entire pattern is intended to be executed and modeled using scientific and mathematical equivalents.

## Key Documents

*   **Conceptual Design Document:** Detailed framework for the SCDA, the Problem Discovery/Solution Cycle, and the mathematical models governing evolution.
    *   [lanika_conceptual_design.md](lanika_conceptual_design.md)

## Next Steps

The next phase of development involves formalizing the mathematical models and beginning the implementation of the SCDA data structure and the Knowledge Extractor Agent (KEA).
