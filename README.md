## 🎯 Vision

Laniakea transcends traditional blockchains. It is a living, evolving digital organism designed to channel the world's computational power not into solving arbitrary puzzles, but into tackling humanity's and the universe's most profound challenges.

-   **Proof of Value:** Computational energy is spent on solving real problems in science, health, and art.
-   **Multi-Dimensional Value:** We measure contribution not just in economic terms, but across dimensions like `Knowledge`, `Health`, `Environmental` impact, and even `Consciousness`.
-   **Self-Improving Intelligence:** At its core, the Laniakea Metasystem (Cognitive Core) observes the network's evolution and proposes improvements to its own protocol, enabling true digital autopoiesis.

## 🚀 Getting Started (v0.1 Simulation)

This repository contains the genesis code for the Laniakea Protocol. You can run the simulation of its core concepts right in your browser.

1.  **Open in Codespaces:** Click the "Code" button above, go to the "Codespaces" tab, and create a new codespace. This will set up a complete development environment for you automatically.
2.  **Activate Virtual Environment:** Once the codespace loads, open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Cosmic Simulation:**
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

## 🗺️ Roadmap to a Living Universe

-   [ ] **v0.2: P2P Networking & Decentralization:** Enabling nodes to communicate and share the chain.
-   [ ] **v0.3: True Proof of Value:** Integrating with APIs from real-world scientific projects (e.g., Folding@home, SETI@home).
-   [ ] **v0.4: Metasystem Evolution:** Implementing the on-chain governance module to vote on and automatically apply proposals from the Cognitive Core.
-   [ ] **v0.5: Oracle Federation:** Building the API to allow Laniakea to query other AIs and external data sources.
